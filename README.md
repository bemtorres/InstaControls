**InstaControls** is a lightweight and powerful Chrome extension designed to enhance your Instagram experience. It enables native video playback controls and allows you to **download videos and photos** directly from your feed, stories, or reels.

## Features

- **Native Video Controls**: Enables the standard browser playback bar (play/pause, volume, fullscreen, playback speed) on any Instagram video.
- **Universal Downloads**: Download **Videos** (Reels, Stories, Feed) and **Photos** in high quality directly to your computer.
- **Unobtrusive Interface**: Buttons appear subtly over the media content (video or photo) and do not interfere with navigation.
- **Reels & Stories Compatible**: Adjusted to avoid overlapping with native Instagram interface controls.

## Installation

1.  **Clone or Download** this repository.
2.  Open Google Chrome and go to: `chrome://extensions`
3.  Enable **"Developer mode"**.
4.  Click on **"Load unpacked"**.

## How to Use

1.  Go to [Instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com).
2.  Browse your feed, stories, or reels.
3.  You will see new icons over the media content:
    *   **Settings Icon**: Shows native video controls.
    *   **Download Icon**: Saves the current photo or video to your device.
