# Privacy Policy for InstaControls

**Effective Date:** January 28, 2026

## Introduction

**InstaControls** ("we," "us," or "our") is a Chrome Extension designed to enhance the Instagram user experience by providing native video controls and download capabilities. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting it.

## Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.**

The extension operates entirely locally on your device. It interacts with the Instagram website (`instagram.com`) solely to:
1.  Inject video control interfaces into the DOM.
2.  Facilitate the download of media files (images and videos) requested by you.

No data related to your browsing history, Instagram account, login credentials, or media content is sent to our servers or any third-party servers.

## Third-Party Data Transfer

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to outside parties.
*   We do not use or transfer user data to third parties outside of the approved use cases (which currently, there are none, as we do not collect data).

## Single Purpose Policy

We do not use or transfer user data for purposes that are unrelated to the single purpose of the extension, which is **Multimedia Management and Control** (enhancing video playback and enabling downloads on Instagram).

## Prohibited Uses (Credit and Lending)

We strictly adhere to the Chrome Web Store policies:
*   **We do not use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes.**

## Permissions Justification

*   **`storage`**: Used only to save your local preferences (e.g., volume settings) on your own device.
*   **`downloads`**: Used exclusively to save the media files you explicitly choose to download.
*   **Host Permissions (`*://*.instagram.com/*`)**: Required to modify the web page layout to add the control buttons.
